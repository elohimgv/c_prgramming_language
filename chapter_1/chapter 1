# Learning the C programming language. 

## Why?
Because I like so much how things works from the beginning. I think that I have a very abstract thinking. Layer after layer
searching the main components of my computer, from a low level to high level. I was inspired from [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).
I was scared by Ai... should I learn how things work from the beginning? I don't know, but I want to. If exist an Ai system 
with the capability to do much things, is faster than you... why should I learn C? ðŸ¤”
