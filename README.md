# Learning the C Programming Language. 

## Why?
Because I like so much how things works from the beginning. I think that I have a very abstract thinking. Layer after layer
searching the main components of my computer, from a low level to high level. I was inspired from [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).
I was scared by Ai... should I learn how things work from the beginning? I don't know, but I want to. If exist an Ai system 
with the capability to do much things, is faster than you... why should I learn C? ðŸ¤”

## Each chapter... 
Contains a section named _Things that I remember_ on where I recall the chapter reading from the book C Programming Language. Maybe my memory remember wrong things from the book, but I want to prove my memory and do the necesary updates when I checking my notes.
