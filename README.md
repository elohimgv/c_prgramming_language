# Learning the C Programming Language. 

## Why?
Because I like so much how things works from the beginning. I think that I have a very abstract thinking. Layer after layer
searching the main components of my computer, from a low level to high level. I was inspired from [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).
I was scared by Ai... should I learn how things work from the beginning? I don't know, but I want to. If exist an Ai system 
with the capability to do much things, is faster than you... why should I learn C? ðŸ¤”

## Each chapter... 
Contains a section named [_Things that I remember_](https://github.com/elohimgv/c_prgramming_language/blob/main/chapter_1/chapter%201) on where I recall the chapter reading from the book [C Programming Language](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/c-programming-language/9780133086249/). Maybe my memory remember wrong things from the book, but I want to prove my memory and do the necesary updates when I checking my notes.
